# Simple Dynamic Notes App

## Overview
- This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing notes and reminders. The app features a laid-back user interface that's easy to navigate and use.
- The purpose of this project was to solidify my understanding of JavaScript and CSS before moving on to more advanced technologies like React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. I believe in mastering the basics before diving into relatively advanced tech.

## Features
- Adding, editing and deleting reminders.
- Adding, editing and deleting notes.

## Future Plans
- Add pomodoro support as well as github inspired activities chart.
